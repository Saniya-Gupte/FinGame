# FortifyFi — Build Plan
> 3-day course project. Mark blocks with [x] when done, cross off with ~~text~~ if scrapped.

---

## Branding
- **Product name:** FortifyFi
- **Concept:** Tower defense game where your financial discipline = your defenses

---

## Stack
- **Frontend:** React + Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Game Engine:** Phaser.js
- **Backend/DB:** Supabase (auth + database + real-time)
- **AI:** Local LLM via Ollama (free, no API costs — model: `qwen2.5:7b`)
- **Bank Data:** Nessie API (Capital One hackathon sandbox — synthetic data)
- **Deployment:** Vercel

---

## Game Design

### Towers
All towers are unlocked/upgraded using points earned from good financial behavior.

| Tower | Financial Concept | Mechanic |
|-------|------------------|----------|
| **Archer Tower** | Basic budgeting | Fast attack, low damage — consistent spending control |
| **Cannon Tower** | Lump sum saving | Slow, high damage — big savings hits hard |
| **Frost Tower** | Debt freeze | Slows enemies — represents freezing unnecessary spending |
| **Mortar Tower** | Investment returns | Area of effect — money working for you, hits multiple targets |
| **Wall** | Emergency fund | Passive blocker — absorbs hits before enemies reach city |

> **MVP towers (Day 2):** Archer Tower + Cannon Tower only. Frost, Mortar, Wall = v2.

---

### NPCs
Each NPC is a local LLM call with a distinct character system prompt. They appear proactively at trigger points and are always clickable for more advice.

| NPC | Archetype | Financial Role | Trigger |
|-----|-----------|---------------|---------|
| **The Warden** | Strict enforcer | Calls out overspending hard, no sugar coating | Budget exceeded |
| **The Scout** | Recon specialist | Spots hidden/recurring charges you forgot about | Subscription/recurring charge detected |
| **The Alchemist** | Wise sage | Long-term strategy, turns bad habits into insights | Week start review |
| **The Merchant** | Shrewd trader | Spending pattern analysis, deal-spotting | Shopping category spikes |
| **The Oracle** | Mysterious seer | Predicts next week's risk based on trends | End of week summary |

> **MVP NPCs (Day 3):** The Warden + The Scout only. Others = v2.

---

### Enemies
Wave difficulty is set by the Game Engine Agent based on weekly financial score.

| Score | Wave Type | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| 80–100 | Easy | Small, slow enemies — good week, light pressure |
| 50–79 | Medium | Mixed fast/slow enemies |
| 0–49 | Hard | Fast swarms + tanky units, city starts slightly damaged |

> Enemy types are generic sprites for MVP. Named enemies (e.g. "Impulse Spender", "Subscription Creep") = v2.

---

### Core Game Loop
```
Every week:
1. Nessie sync → transactions pulled
2. Analyst Agent → categorize + score (0–100)
3. Game Engine Agent → configure enemy wave based on score
4. User plays tower defense session
5. End of game → points saved, NPC triggered, city state updated
```

---

## Agent Architecture

### Agent 1 — Financial Analyst Agent
**Trigger:** Weekly sync  
**Tools:**
- `get_transactions(account_id, date_range)` — Nessie API
- `categorize_spending(transactions)` — groups into food, subscriptions, shopping, etc.
- `calculate_score(spending_vs_goal)` — returns 0–100
- `detect_patterns(transactions)` — recurring charges, risky habits, savings streaks

**Output:** Structured financial profile → written to Supabase

---

### Agent 2 — Game Engine Agent
**Trigger:** After Analyst Agent completes  
**Tools:**
- `get_financial_profile(user_id)` — reads from Supabase
- `generate_wave_config(score)` — returns enemy count, speed, HP, spawn rate
- `apply_rewards(score)` — unlocks towers/upgrades
- `write_game_config(user_id, config)` — writes wave params to Supabase

---

### Agent 3 — NPC Agent *(v2)*
**Trigger:** Proactive (budget exceeded, week start, subscription detected) or user click  
**Tools:**
- `get_financial_profile(user_id)`
- `get_flagged_transactions(user_id)`
- `generate_npc_dialogue(npc_character, context)` — LLM call with character system prompt

---

### Agent 4 — Goal Setting Agent *(v2)*
**Trigger:** Week start  
**Tools:**
- `analyze_history(user_id, past_weeks)`
- `suggest_goal(profile, history)` — personalized weekly savings target
- `validate_goal(user_input)` — checks if user-set goal is realistic

---

## Supabase Schema

```
users           — id, email, created_at (linked to Supabase auth)
game_state      — user_id, points, city_health, week_number, towers_placed, level
weekly_goals    — user_id, goal_amount, actual_spent, score, week_start_date
transactions    — user_id, nessie_id, amount, category, merchant, date, flagged
wave_config     — user_id, week_number, enemy_count, enemy_speed, enemy_hp, spawn_rate
```

## Before Day 1 — You Do This (~30 min)
- [ ] Nessie API key → register at `api.nessieisreal.com`
- [ ] Supabase project → `supabase.com` (free tier, grab URL + anon key)
- [x] Install Ollama → `ollama.com`, then run: `ollama pull qwen2.5:7b` ✓

---

## Day 1 — Foundation & Data Layer

### Block 1 — Project Scaffolding (~2 hrs) ✓

## Risk Register

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|
| Phaser SSR crash in Next.js | High | Dynamic import fix, handled in Block 4 |
| Game balance feels off | Medium | Playtest + report back, I tune numbers |
| Local LLM response quality | Medium | Prompt engineering, fallback to rule-based if needed |
| Nessie API flakiness | Low-Med | Local mock data fallback |
| Visual polish lacking | High | Functional first, polish if time allows |

---
